Design Pattern :- 
	It's an solution to general problems which software developers faced during application development. It is language independent. Here     i will write all example in java.  

Need of Design Pattern :- 
	For solving a problem in a way by which will includes these factors :- 
	how to create a class, how to write a resuable code, how to intraction between objects, how to instantiate an object, how to make our 	  code loosly coupled.

Benefits of Design Pattern :-
	Code reusability, Maintainable code, Loosely coupled code, Reduce cost of implementation

Types of Design Pattern :-
	1.) Creational :- It's deals with how to instantiate an object in the best possible way based on situation.
	2.) Structural :- It's deals with structure of the class like how to create a complex class using inheritance etc. So, we can get more 		benefits from those and code should be more reusable.
	3.) Behavioral : It's deals with how objects will communicate each others and how to provide loose coupling between them.
